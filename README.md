# EPiCode.InstagramProvider
This is currently just some very unstable code that was created in a quick and dirty hackathon, and only used for demo purposes.
It will load content from instagram, and display it in a gadget for edit mode. You can drag and drop images. However, once you refresh the page the image references will be incorrect.
In order to get this to work it will require quite some work.

Also, a instagram client ID is needed. You can get one at https://instagram.com/developer/clients/manage/
